# Contributing to Streamlit-Analytics

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use GitHub Flow

All code changes happen through pull requests, so we suggest you familiarize yourself with [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make sure your code lints.
3. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the same license as the project

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [license](LICENSE.md) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/jrieke/streamlit-analytics/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/jrieke/streamlit-analytics/issues/new); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
